#- ArabicRandomNameGenerator
This is a very basic one main java class that generates Arabic names based on initial seeds. Initial set of seed names are stored in couple files, one for male names and other one for female names. Based on a few configuration values (hard-coded in the initial draft version) the program generates male or female names (in form of SQL update statements in the initial draft version) and store them in a separate txt file.
